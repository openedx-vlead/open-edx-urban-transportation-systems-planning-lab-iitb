<p class="PreformattedText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';" lang="EN-IN"> Calibration is an important step as it estimates the value of &alpha; or &beta; or c depending on the friction factor function in the gravity equation given below such that the model best fits the base year observations. Thus proper value of c fixes the relationship between the travel time factor and the interzonal impedance. Initially a value of c is assumed and applied using a base year observation of production, attraction and impedance to compute interzonal volumes which are then compared with the observed volume of the base year condition. If the value obtained of c gives close to the observed value then it can be used otherwise its value is changed and further iteration is done. Iteration is carried until sufficient convergence value of c is obtained. For calibration generally friction factor F is used rather than parameter c. </span></p>
