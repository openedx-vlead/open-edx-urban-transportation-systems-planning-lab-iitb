<div class="divContent">1.<b> Is System optimization a realistic model? If not, why we use it to model flow in a network?</b><br /> System optimization is not a realistic model but it is very useful to transport planners and engineers, trying to manage the traffic to minimise travel costs and therefore achieve an optimum social equilibrium.<br /><br /> 2.<b>Can User equilibrium and system optimal produce identical results?</b><br /> When congestion effects are ignored (i.e. travel time is independent of flow) , User equilibrium and system optimal have same optimization function and hence produce identical results.</div>
