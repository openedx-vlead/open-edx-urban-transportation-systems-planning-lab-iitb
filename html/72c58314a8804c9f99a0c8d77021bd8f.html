Texture discrimination techniques are for the part ad hoc. Perception of texture is dependent on the spatial organization of gray level or color variations. Manmade features have a repetitive pattern, where a basic pattern or primitive is replicated over a region. Large variation within the pattern leads to a textured appearance, while flat regions lead to a smooth appearance.<br /><br /> <b>Sample textures</b><br /><br /> </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';" lang="EN-IN"> <b>What is Texture?</b><br /><br /> A feature used to partition images into regions of interest and to classify those regions. texture can be understood as spatial arrangement of colors or intensities in an image. It is characterized by the spatial distribution of intensity levels in a neighborhood. It can also be considered as a repeating pattern of local variations in image. It is an area attribute, not defined at a point.<br /><br /> <b>Notion of Texture</b><br /><br /> Suppose an image has a 50% black and 50% white distribution of pixels. With this same intensity distribution, a number of texture images can be formed. e.g., below are the three different images with the same intensity distribution, but with different textures.<br /><br /> </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';" lang="EN-IN"> <b>Composition of Texture</b><br /><br /> Texture is made up of texture primitives, called texels. It can be described as fine, coarse, grained or smooth, etc. Tone is based on pixel intensity properties in the texel, while structure represents the spatial relationship between texels. If texels are small and tonal differences between texels are large a fine texture results. If texels are large and consist of several pixels, a coarse texture results.<br /><br /> <b>Texture Analysis</b><br /><br /> Two primary issues in texture analysis are:<br /><br /> - Texture classification<br /><br /> - Texture segmentation<br /><br /> Texture classification is concerned with identifying a given textured region from a given set of texture classes. Each of these regions has unique texture characteristics. Statistical methods are extensively used.<br /><br /> Texture segmentation is concerned with automatically determining the boundaries between various texture regions in an image.<br /><br /> <b>Approaches to Measure Texture</b><br /><br /> There are a lot of approaches exists to measure texture. some of them are:<br /><br /> -Gray Lever Co-occurrence matrix approach<br /><br /> -Edge per unit area<br /><br /> -First Order Statistics<br /><br /> -Mean / average, Standard deviation<br /><br /> -Mean Deviation, Range, Median,<br /><br /> -Skewness<br /><br /> -Higher order statistics<br /><br /> -Measuring energy in various frequency sub-bands<br /><br /> -Fractal modeling<br /><br /> -Geostatistical methods<br /><br /> -Wavelet transform approaches, etc.<br /><br /> <b>Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix Approach(GLCM)</b><br /><br /> GLCM is based on second order statistics (2-D histogram). It is conjectured that textures differing in second order statistics are indeed different. Therefore numerical features were extracted from the image in terms of the second-order statistics that were a measure of the underlying texture.<br /><br /> <b>Definition of GLCM</b><br /><br /> The GLCM is defined by:<br /><br /> Pd(i,j) = ni,j = #{f(m,n) = i, f(m+dx, n+dy) = j; (1&le;m&le;M; 1&le;n &le;N}<br /><br /> &ndash; where nij is the number of occurrences of the pixel values (i,j) lying at distance d in the image.<br /><br /> &ndash; The co-occurrence matrix Pd has dimension n&times; n, where n is the number of gray levels in the image.<br /><br /> <b>Construction of GLCM</b><br /><br /> A co-occurrence matrix is a two-dimensional array, P, in which both the rows and the columns represent a set of possible image values. A GLCM Pd[i,j] is defined by first specifying a displacement vector d=(dx,dy) and counting all pairs of pixels separated by d having gray levels i and j. (dx,dy) define the directionality of texture;<br /><br /> - dx=1,dy=0 represents horizontal direction.<br /><br /> - dx=1,dy=1 represents diagonal direction<br /><br /> <b>Example</b><br /><br /> Consider the pixel data, the required direction and co-occurrence matrix below. There are 16 pairs of pixels in the image which satisfy this spatial separation. Since there are only three gray levels &ndash; 0,1,2, P[i,j] is a 3&times;3 matrix.<br /><br /> </span></p>

This count is entered in the ith row and jth column of the matrix Pd[i,j].<br /><br /> Note: Pd[i,j] is not symmetric in this form of counting, since the number of pairs of pixels having gray levels [i,j] does not necessarily equal the number of pixel pairs having gray levels [j,i].<br /><br /> <b>Normalized GLCM</b><br /><br /> The elements of Pd[i,j] can be normalized by dividing each entry by the total number of pixel pairs.

Numeric features are computed from the co-occurrence matrix that can be used to represent the texture more compactly.<br /><br /> Following are the features that can be computed from GLCM:<br /><br /> <b>Angular Second Moment (ASM)</b><br /><br /> ASM is calculated as :<br /><br /> </span></p>

It is highly computation intensive. Often the image is reduced to fewer gray levels before the computation is carried out. Efficient computational procedures are derived to incrementally re-compute the co-occurrence matrix or the texture features.<br /><br /> </span></p>
