<p><b>1.When to use doubly constrained model? </b><br /> The doubly constrained model can be used when the following condition is satisfied.<br /> &sum;jTij=Oi<br /> When sum of all the trips attracted to all the attraction zones will be equal to the total number of trips produced in a production zone<br />. Mathematically: $$\nonumber \sum \limits_{j} T_{ij} = O_{i}$$ <br /> When sum of trips produced for all the trip production zones will be equal to the number of trips attracted to a destination zone.<br /> Mathematically: $$\nonumber \sum \limits_{j} T_{ij} = D_{i}$$</p>
