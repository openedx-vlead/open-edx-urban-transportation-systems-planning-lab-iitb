<li><b>What is SSE?</b><br /> <span class="answers"> SSE stands for the sum of squares due to error (SSE). This statistic measures the total deviation of the response values from the fit to the response values. It is also called the summed square of residuals and is usually labelled as SSE. A value closer to 0 indicates that the model has a smaller random error component, and that the fit will be more useful for prediction. </span></li>
<li><b>What Input data should be considered?</b><br /> <span class="answers">The modeller must decide which variables are relevant to the decision making process but the most common variables for urban and interurban travel are: in-vehicle time, walk time, wait time, cost and how many interchanges are involved. This data can be 'skimmed' from the highway and public transport networks for each origin-destination pair to form matrices which are called skims because they are obtained from the paths by skimming along the paths accumulating the data. The networks can therefore be skimmed for in-vehicle time, walk time, fare, etc and each skim put into the mode choice model. In this case the mode choice model will split an input trip matrix into a trip matrix which uses each mode of transport, e.g. car and public transport.</span></li>

<li><b> What is the criterion for &beta; convergence?</b><br /> <span class="answers">At convergence the &beta; value satisfies the equality between the estimated trip distribution matrix and the observed trip distribution matrix. </span></li>
