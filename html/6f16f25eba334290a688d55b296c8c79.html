<p><b> 1.What is SSE? </b><br /> SSE stands for the sum of squares due to error (SSE). This statistic measures the total deviation of the response values from the fit to the response values. It is also called the summed square of residuals and is usually labelled as SSE. A value closer to 0 indicates that the model has a smaller random error component, and that the fit will be more useful for prediction. <br /><br /></p>
<p><b>2.What is the criterion for &beta; convergence?</b></p>
<p>At convergence the &beta; value satisfies the equality between the estimated trip distribution matrix and the observed trip distribution matrix.</p>
