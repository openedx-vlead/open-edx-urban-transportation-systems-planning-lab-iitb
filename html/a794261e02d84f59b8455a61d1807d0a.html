<p><b> 1.When to use origin constrained and destination constrained model? </b><br /> Origin constrained model can be used when sum of all the trips attracted to all the attraction zones will be equal to the total number of trips produced in a production zone. Mathematically:<br /> &sum;jTij=Oi<br /> Destination constrained model can be used when sum of trips produced for all the trip production zones will be equal to the number of trips attracted to a destination zone. Mathematically:<br /> &sum;jTij=Di </p>
<p><b>2.What is Travel Impedance?</b><br /> Travel Impedance is known as generalized cost for travel. Travel impedance of generalized cost is a function of in-vehicle-travel-time, waiting time, fare, discomfort level, transfer time, walk time etc.</p>
