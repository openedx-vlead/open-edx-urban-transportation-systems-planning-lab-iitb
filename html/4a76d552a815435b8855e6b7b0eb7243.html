<p class="PreformattedText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';" lang="EN-IN"> Modal share, Mode split or Mode choice analysis is the third step in the conventional four-step transportation forecasting model, following trip generation and trip distribution but before route assignment. In Trip distribution step, zonal interchange analysis yields a set of origin destination tables which tells where the trips will be made. Mode choice analysis allows the modeller to determine what mode of transport will be used, and what modal share results. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Traditionally, the objective of transportation planning is to forecast the growth in demand for car trips in order to plan the investment to meet the demand. When personal characteristics were thought to be the most important determinants of mode choice, attempts were made to apply modal-split models immediately after trip generation. Such a model is called trip-end modal split model. In this way different characteristics of the person could be preserved and used to estimate modal split. The modal split models of this time related is the choice of mode related to features like income, residential density and car ownership. The advantage is that these models could be very accurate in the short run, if public transport is available and there is little congestion. Limitation is that they are insensitive to policy decisions, for example: Improving public transport, restricting parking etc. would have no effect on modal split according to these trip-end models.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the post-distribution model; that is modal split is applied after the distribution stage. This has the advantage that it is possible to include the characteristics of the journey and that of the alternative modes available to undertake them. It is also possible to include policy decisions. This is beneficial for long term modelling.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Mode choice could be aggregate if they are based on zonal and inter-zonal information. They can be called disaggregate if they are based on household or individual data.</p>

<hr />
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mode choice models are found in numerous formulations, but the most common are based on the probabilities estimated by some variation or sophistication of the logit function.The common logit mode choice relationship states that the probability of choosing a particular mode for a given trip is based on the relative values of the costs and levels of service on the competing modes for the trip interchange being considered.</p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The level of service provided by a particular mode for a specific trip interchange is usually represented in part by the travel time for that interchange as computed from the transit and roadway networks. The travel time components used to represent level of service include the in-vehicle travel time for each mode and the out-of-vehicle time required to use that mode, such as walking to a transit stop or from a parking lot. The level of service also includes the waiting time likely to be experienced, either to board transit or to transfer. The delay due to roadway traffic congestion is included inherently by using attenuated speeds for congested roadway network links.</p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The travel time and cost of a trip are usually combined using an estimate of the cost of time to convert either cost or time to the terms of the other. The cost of time is usually a variable, based on the economic level of the traveler. Although the mode choice model may be developed using the economic level of individual travelers, forecasts of mode choice are prepared for different economic groups, such as high, medium, and low income travelers. The resulting combination of time and cost is commonly referred to as the "generalized cost". The traveler will associate some value for the utility of each mode. If the utility of one mode is higher than the other, then that mode is chosen. But in transportation, we have disutility also. The disutility here is the travel cost. This can be represented as (for one particular mode from origin i to destination j)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The logit formulation is not a complex mathematical function nor is the utility/disutility function it employs. The difficulty in developing a logit model is encountered in estimating the considerable number of parameters for variables in the utility/disutility function. The estimation is accomplished using one or another multivariate statistical analysis program to optimize the accuracy of estimates of coefficients of several independent variables. Thus the proportion of trips by mode 1 is given by</p>

<p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The total number of trips from zone i to zone j is 4200. Currently all trips are made by car. Government has two alternatives- to introduce a train or a bus. The travel characteristics and respective coefficients are given in table below. Decide the best alternative in terms of trips carried.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">First, use binary logit model to find the trips when there is only car and bus. Then, again use binary logit model to find the trips when there is only car and train. Finally compare both and see which alternative carry maximum trips.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Cost of travel by car = C <sub>car</sub> = 0.05&lowast;25+0.2&lowast;22+0.2&lowast;6 = 6.85</p>
