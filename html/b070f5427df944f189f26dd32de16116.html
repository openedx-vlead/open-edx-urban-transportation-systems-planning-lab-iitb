<p><b>System Optimal Assignment</b></p>
<p></p>
<p class="PreformattedText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';" lang="EN-IN"> Wardrop (1952) proposed an alternative way of assigning traffic onto a network and this is usually referred to as his second principle: Under social equilibrium condition traffic should be arranged in congested networks in such a way that the average (or total) travel cost is minimised.<br /><br /> This is a design principle, in contrast with his first principle which endeavours to model the behavior of individual driver trying to minimize their own trip costs. The second principle is oriented towards transport planners and engineers trying to manage traffic to minimize travel costs and therefore achieve an optimum social equilibrium. In general the flows resulting from the two principles are not the same but one can only expect, in practice, traffic to arrange itself following an approximation to Wardrop's first principle, i.e. selfish or users' equilibrium.<br /><br /> Obviously, this is not a behaviourally realistic model, but it can be useful to transport planners and engineers, trying to manage the traffic to minimise travel costs and therefore achieve an optimum social equilibrium.<br /><br /> </span></p>

<ul>
<li>UE and SO are similar if congestion is ignored.</li>
<li>If the link performance function is independent of link flows then UE objective function is similar to SO objective function.</li>
<li>A network with low flow has small marginal link cost as a result UE and SO flows are similar.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><br /> Example</p>
<hr />
<p><br /> To demonstrate how the most common assignment works, an example network is considered. This network has two nodes having two paths as links. <br /> <img src="http://civil13-iitb.base1.vlabs.ac.in/exp12/img/exp10.1.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 250px; margin-left: 10%;" /> </p>
<p class="PreformattedText"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';" lang="EN-IN"> Lets take a case where travel time functions for both the links is given by:<br /><br /> t1=10+3x1<br /><br /> t2=15+2x2<br /><br /> and total flows from 1 to 2.<br /><br /> q12=12<br /><br /> Substituting the travel time in formulation of system optimal, we get the following:<br /><br /> min: Z(x)=x1; 10+3x21+x2(15+2x2)<br /><br /> 10x1+3x21+15x2+2x22<br /><br /> Substituting x2=12&minus;x1 in the above formulations take the following form:<br /><br /> 10x1+3x21+15(12&minus;x1)+2(12&minus;x1)2<br /><br /> Differentiate the above equation w.r.t x1 and equate to zero, and solving for and then x2 leads to the solution x&lowast;i=5.3, x&lowast;2=6.7, and Z(x&lowast;)=327.55.<br /><br /> <b>Brass&lsquo;s Paradox</b></span></p>
<hr />
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>User Equilibrium assum&lsquo;s that driver&lsquo;s minimize their own travel cost without considering the impact on the network. Thus there is no guarantee that system travel cost will become less.</li>
<li>If the traffic is assigned as per SO, the system travel cost will not increase with the addition of a link.</li>
</ul>

Thus the new UE flow will be :<br /><br /> 50+x1+10x3=50+x4+10x2=10x2+10+x5+10x3<br /><br /> Solving we get x1=2, x2=4, x3=4, x4=2, x5=2<br /><br /> Cost for Path 1 = 92, Path 2 = 92 and Path 3 = 92<br /><br /> Path cost increases with an introduction of extra link, similarly System cost also increases.<br /><br /> </span></p>
